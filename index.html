        Hello everyone and welcome to my profile page. This is a class project; part of my
        triumphant return to academia. This coding boot camp is a long time coming. For the
        last few years I have been looking for a way to change directions in my life. I have
        always had an interest in computer coding, specifically in web development. I started
        down that road in the late 90s but instead took a different path into journalism. Its
        only recently that I discovered coding boot camps and thought they were perfect for my
        particular situation. I didnâ€™t have the financial resources or time to go back for a
        traditional C.S. degree.</p>
<p>
        I am a year behind my initial plan. In November 2017 I took my online assessment,
        interviewed and actually put my deposit down in December for class in April. Almost one
        month later, January 16th 2018, I had a massive heart attack. Although I survived, it
        damaged my heart severely and I started the process of regaining my strength. A month
        before class would start I had another incident with my heart where it went into
        V-tack, which meant more heart surgery, an ICD implant and starting over on my heart
        rehab. I spent the last year fighting to regain some of my strength and getting myself
        into the best position I could possibly be health wise.
</p>

        This last winter was a true test of my health. My current job is a Letter Carrier for
        the USPS. The volume of mail and packages during Christmas is staggering; hundreds of
        packages per day. Sometimes I worked Thirteen hour shifts, 7 days a week. I have been
        tested and I am ready for anything new. I look forward to changing careers and I know
        after what I have been through this year that nothing will stand in my way.</p>
